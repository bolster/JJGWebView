--- README for JJGWebView ---

This is an iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad UIWebView implementation for reuse in
iOS Apps, highlighting methods and design for a usable and intuitive in-app
browser.

- USAGE -

Look inside JJGWebViewViewController.m for implementation details. Basically,
if you're using a Table View inside a Navigation Controller, you can just
pop a JJGWebView on your navigation stack, and the class will take care of the
rest.

You would normally do this inside a didSelectRowAtIndexPath: (in table view)
or calloutAccessoryTapped: (in map view) method.
